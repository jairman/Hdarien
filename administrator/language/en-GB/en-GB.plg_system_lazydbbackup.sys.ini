Do not modify options if you don't know what you do! Final step: go to plugin manager, open LazyDbBackup - put in your email address in the parameters and publish the plugin.\nAn option allows you to disable mail: backup files are then preserved in the definite folder - by default the "_QQ_"/media"_QQ_" folder -"
